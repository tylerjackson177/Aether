#### Description:
This algorithmic trading model is designed to analyze and trade based on divergence patterns between two financial instruments using multiple timeframes. Its versatility allows it to be applied across various timeframes, from weekly to intraday, adapting to different trading strategies and market conditions. Here's an in-depth description of the model, including its fractal nature and user inputs based on different timeframes.

Model Structure and Functionality
The core of this trading model is built around the concept of divergence, which identifies discrepancies between the price movements of two correlated assets. The model employs a multi-timeframe analysis approach, which enhances its robustness by considering a range of timeframes. This is done to capture both macro and micro market trends and nuances.

Timeframe Selection:

Weekly: The highest timeframe provides a broad perspective on market trends and cycles. Analyzing weekly data helps in identifying long-term trends and potential turning points in the market. This timeframe is particularly useful for understanding the overarching market dynamics and setting a strategic outlook.
Daily: The daily timeframe narrows the focus to more immediate market conditions, offering a clearer picture of daily price action and short-term trends. This timeframe is often used to fine-tune entry and exit points based on the broader trend observed on the weekly chart.
4-Hour: This timeframe provides a more granular view of the market, capturing intra-day price movements and trends. The 4-hour timeframe is ideal for traders who wish to engage in more frequent trading while still maintaining a broader perspective gained from the higher timeframes.
Fractal Nature: The model is fractal, meaning that its underlying principles are applicable across various timeframes. This fractal characteristic allows the model to maintain its efficacy whether it is applied to a weekly, daily, or intraday timeframe. By leveraging fractal analysis, the model can detect patterns and trends that are consistent across different scales of time, ensuring that trading signals are robust and reliable regardless of the timeframe used.

User Inputs and Customization
The model is designed to be flexible and user-driven, allowing traders to input their preferences based on the desired timeframe and trading strategy. Here’s how users can customize the model:

Bearish or Bullish Setup: Users can specify whether they are interested in a bearish or bullish trading setup. This input guides the model in determining the appropriate divergence conditions to look for. For a bearish setup, the model will focus on identifying conditions where the price of one asset is making new highs while the correlated asset is not, indicating a potential reversal or weakness. Conversely, for a bullish setup, the model looks for conditions where the price of one asset is making new lows while the correlated asset is not, signaling potential buying opportunities.

Timeframe Selection: Users are prompted to select the highest timeframe to be analyzed, starting from weekly down to daily and finally to the 4-hour timeframe. This selection helps in tailoring the model’s analysis to the user’s trading style and market focus. For example:

Weekly Timeframe Analysis: Provides insights into long-term trends and potential market shifts.
Daily Timeframe Analysis: Offers a detailed view of daily price movements and helps in refining trade decisions based on the weekly trend.
4-Hour Timeframe Analysis: Enables intraday trading opportunities and more precise timing for entries and exits.
Divergence Conditions: The model calculates divergence between two assets by comparing their highs and lows specifically on the 1 hour timeframe. Divergence is detected when there is a discrepancy between the price movements of the two assets, such as one making higher highs while the other does not. This analysis is essential for identifying potential trade opportunities and market inefficiencies.

Trade Execution: Based on the divergence signals and user inputs, the model generates trade recommendations, including entry and exit points. For a bearish setup, the model will suggest selling opportunities with predefined stop-loss and take-profit levels. For a bullish setup, it will recommend buying opportunities with corresponding risk management parameters.

Versatility and Application
The model’s fractal nature allows it to be applied to any timeframe, making it versatile for different trading styles and market conditions. Whether used for long-term investments or short-term trading, the model adapts its analysis to the selected timeframe, providing valuable insights and trade signals. Traders can utilize the model for various asset classes, including stocks, forex, and commodities, ensuring that its principles are universally applicable.

In summary, this algorithmic trading model offers a sophisticated approach to trading by leveraging multi-timeframe divergence analysis. Its fractal nature ensures that it remains effective across different timeframes, from weekly to intraday. By allowing users to customize their inputs based on the desired timeframe and trading setup, the model provides a flexible and robust tool for identifying trading opportunities and managing risk.
